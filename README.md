Warning: This Repo is under HEAVY ongoing construction/refactor/redesign.  Vast majority of the system does not work at this time. I will remove this, and possibly pin some official versions when it is.


# RockInventory
Highly opinionated inventory used for BRS games. 

BRS has used variety of existing inventory systems for various periods of time but never created an original inventory system.
Game Inventories system are often game specific with plenty of opinions about game design and sometimes genre specific. 

Feel free to use, learn from, reference, enjoy, or contribute! 

There are many other great inventory systems out there.
* Lyra's Inventory System by Epic (Unreal Engine)
    * Supposedly inspired by UEFN's inventory system
    * ItemFragment system concept is great. 
* ArcInventory by Puny Human and RoyAwesome
    * 2nd favorite which is heavily inspired from some of Lyra's core design.
    * Highly recommend if you want general purpose inventory. Prototype friendly!
    * Efficient minimal opinion a super solid backend. 
* InventorySystemX by SixLine Studio
    * This has some nice UI/UX aspect. 
* InventoryFrameworkPlugin by Varian Daemon
    * This has a neat custom shaped items. 
Other notable mentions
* RPG Inventory Template
* Inventory Grid by LucasBastos
* Action Rpg Inventory System by VAnguard interactive


Heavily influenced designs by games like Diablo, Path of Exile, Escape from Tarkov, Subnautica, Minecraft, Dyson Sphere Program, and many more.
